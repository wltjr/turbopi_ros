This project aims to get all functionality of the TurboPi robot running on
[ROS 2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/), along with an RPLidar for SLAM.
The project is a work in progress, used to learn ROS 2, as well as for upcoming
research work into SLAM, navigation without GPS or Compass, dynamic path planning
with encountering unknown newly discovered obstacles, and other research topics.

## Environment Preparation
The following assumes you have installed all the necessary ROS 2 Jazzy packages, and have sourced the installation before running any `ros2` commands.
```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```

You may want to have your development user environment do this on login via `~/.bashrc` file; add that command to the end of that file.

Its recommended to have a ros2 workspace in a user directory for development purposes, to build this project, etc; ex `~/ros2_ws/`. The following will refer to that directory, and directories created within.

## Download
Download and unpack or clone this repositories contents into your ros2 workspace; ex `~/ros2_ws/src/turbopi_ros`.


## Build and Install
Building is done using colcon which will invoke cmake and run the necessary commands. Run the following command in your ros2 workspace; ex `~/ros2_ws/`.
```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select  turbopi_ros
```

### Source install
Make sure to run the following command after install and login. Run the following command in your ros2 workspace; ex `~/ros2_ws/`.
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

You may want to have your development user environment do this on login via `~/.bashrc` file; add the following to the end of that file.
```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

## Run
There are several launchers that are used to run parts of the project, some are
used together, some stand-alone, some for simulation and the robot. They are all
run from your ros2 workspace; ex `~/ros2_ws/`.
```bash
ros2 launch turbopi_ros turbopi_ros.launch.py
```

- [gamepad.launch.py](https://github.com/wltjr/turbopi_ros/blob/main/launch2/gamepad.launch.py) -
Start the gamepad node for remote operation, teleop; run in container, local, or
remote.
- [ign_gazebo.launch.py](https://github.com/wltjr/turbopi_ros/blob/main/launch2/ign_gazebo.launch.py) -
Start a simulated TurboPi in Gazebo; run in container or desktop/laptop.
- [nav2.launch.py](https://github.com/wltjr/turbopi_ros/blob/main/launch2/nav2.launch.py) -
Start the Nav 2 stack, used with both hardware and simulation.
- [turbopi_ros.launch.py](https://github.com/wltjr/turbopi_ros/blob/main/launch2/turbopi_ros.launch.py) -
Start ROS 2 with hardware support for TurboPi on robot hardware.

### Docker Containers
Three docker containers have been made to aid primarily in development, but the
first can be used on actual hardware.

- [docker-ros2-jazzy](https://github.com/UNF-Robotics/docker-ros2-jazzy) -
Base headless container used in CI/CD and can be used on hardware with slight
overhead.
- [docker-ros2-jazzy-gz-rviz2](https://github.com/UNF-Robotics/docker-ros2-jazzy-gz-rviz2) -
Base X11 graphical container used for simulation has Gazebo and RViz2, intended
for desktop/laptop; contains prior.
- [docker-ros2-jazzy-gz-rviz2](https://github.com/wltjr/docker-ros2-jazzy-gz-rviz2-turbopi) -
Main development container used for development, simulation, etc. intended for
desktop/laptop; contains prior two.

The first container is primarily used for CI/CD. The second one is not directly
used. For most purposes, the last container is the primary one to use, outside
of running on the actual robot. Which is advised to do outside of a docker
container to avoid the minimal overhead.


## Robot Human Controllers
The primary way to control the robot is using telop_turbopi which is intended to
be used with a [DUALSHOCK™4](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/dualshock-4-wireless-controller/) wireless controller.


### DUALSHOCK™4
Run the following command to invoke the controller for the DUALSHOCK™4 wireless
controller.
```bash
ros2 launch turbopi_ros gamepad.launch.py
```

#### Button Layout
The primary buttons are the left joystick for driving/movement and the right
joystick for the attached camera. All other buttons are not mapped or in use
at this time.

| Button | Action |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| A | Unused  |
| B | Unused  |
| C | Unused  |
| D | Unused  |
| E | Unused  |
| F | Unused  |
| G | Unused  |
| H | Camera - tilt up/down, pan left/right |
| I | Unused  |
| J | Unused  |
| K | Driving - forward/backward, turn left/right |

### Alternatives
There are presently alternative two ways to control the robot using [teleop twist joy](https://github.com/ros2/teleop_twist_joy) and [keyboard](https://github.com/ros2/teleop_twist_keyboard). However, they only support robot movement and do not control camera or other peripherals, they just use `/cmd_vel` topic.

#### Gamepad
Run the following command to invoke the controller for the gamepad. Sample 
command is  using a Logitech F310, which works with the `xbox` configuration. 
```bash
ros2 launch teleop_twist_joy teleop-launch.py joy_config:='xbox'
```

#### Keyboard
Run the following command to invoke the controller for the keyboard, which will present a interface for controlling the robot in the same terminal the command is run within.
```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```
